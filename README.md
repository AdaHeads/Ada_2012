Ada 2012 Extensions
===================

Some units from the Ada 2012 standard library implemented in Ada 2005.

The idea with this library is that you simply use "Ada_2012." instead of "Ada.", when using units
from the Ada 2012 standard library, which easily can be implemented in Ada 2005. -- Allowing you
a few of the benefits of Ada 2012 even with an Ada 2005 compiler.
